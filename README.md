Collaborative Final Project for EM489 Data-Mining & Risk Assessment at Stevens Institute of Technology

Objective:  
Succesully develop an accurate model to predict whether a patient is likely to have a cardiovascular disease based on their biometrics.

Files:  
CardiovascularDiseasePrediction.R - Saved logs from Rattle library in R.  
CardiovascularDiseasePrediction.pdf - PDF of analysis and methodology report.  
Cardio_Train_USE_FINAL.csv - modified datafile specifically used in the report (original datafile in link below).

Data Source:

Background:   
This project was completed in Late 2022 in collaboration with one other colleage, together forming team Baked Cauliflower.    
This project utilized the Rattle library, which acts as a GUI for R. As such, no code was truly written, but rather we heavily focussed on refining the methodology for data preperation, analysis, and modeling. The steps are thoroughly documented in the report PDF.
